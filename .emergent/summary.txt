The previous AI engineer was tasked with refactoring an existing HTML/JavaScript QR code generator. The core requirements were to reorganize the codebase for better syntax and replace the external  library with a custom implementation. The AI engineer adopted a full-stack approach, starting with the backend. It developed a custom QR code generation library in Python, created corresponding FastAPI endpoints, and integrated it into the . Following backend completion, frontend components were created using React to mirror the original HTML's UI and connect to the new backend APIs. During the process, the AI fixed a linting error in the frontend. Backend testing was then performed, successfully identifying and resolving critical bounds checking issues and color validation within the custom QR code generator, ensuring 100% test pass rate. The application now functions as a full-stack QR code generator with a custom backend library and a React frontend. The current state is backend functionality is verified, and the frontend is developed and rendered correctly.

The primary objective was to take an existing single-page HTML/JavaScript QR Code Generator application and refactor it into a modern full-stack application. This involved:
1.  **Code Reorganization**: Restructure the monolithic HTML file for better maintainability and syntax.
2.  **Custom QR Code Library**: Replace the external  JavaScript library with a custom-developed implementation, likely in Python for the backend.
3.  **Feature Parity**: Maintain all original functionalities, including:
    *   Generating QR codes from vCard data (Name, Phone, Email, Company, Title, Work URL, Home URL).
    *   Customizing QR code colors using HSL sliders and a hex input.
    *   Uploading and embedding a logo within the QR code.
    *   Adjusting logo size.
    *   Selecting different shapes for QR code markers (finder patterns) and dots (square, circle, rounded).
    *   Downloading generated QR codes as PNG and SVG images.
The application was to be built using a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB (though MongoDB's direct role in QR generation data persistence wasn't explicit in this trajectory).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python web framework used for the backend API.
-   **React**: JavaScript library for building the single-page application frontend.
-   **Custom QR Code Generation**: Logic for creating QR code modules, including drawing different shapes (square, circle, rounded) directly onto a canvas, and handling color conversion (HSL to Hex and vice versa).
-   **VCard Format**: Used for encoding contact information into the QR code data.
-   **HTML Canvas API**: Utilized for rendering the QR code graphics and overlaying logos.
-   **Image Handling**: Uploading and rendering logos (PNG) within the QR code.
-   **API Design**: Creating  prefixed endpoints for QR code generation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack project with a clear separation between frontend and backend.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: This file serves as the main entry point for the FastAPI backend application. It was modified to integrate the new custom QR code generation logic and expose API endpoints for QR code creation and potentially other related functionalities.
    -   **Changes Made**: New endpoints were added to handle requests for QR code generation, likely taking parameters such as VCard data, colors, logo, and shape preferences. It calls functions from .
-   **/app/backend/qr_generator.py**:
    -   **Summary**: This is a newly created file that encapsulates the custom QR code generation logic, replacing the external  library. It contains functions for converting HSL to Hex colors, and core logic for rendering QR code modules (dots and markers) with different shapes (square, circle, rounded) onto a virtual canvas, and handling logo embedding.
    -   **Changes Made**: Full implementation of a custom QR code rendering engine from scratch.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Summary**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include any new libraries necessary for the custom  (e.g., image processing libraries if not built-in).
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component that acts as the container for the entire frontend application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to import and render the new  component. A lint error (duplicate export ) was identified and fixed.
-   **/app/frontend/src/QRCodeGenerator.js**:
    -   **Summary**: This is a newly created React component responsible for rendering the entire user interface of the QR code generator. It contains all the input fields, sliders, buttons, and the canvas for displaying the QR code, mirroring the original HTML structure and functionality.
    -   **Changes Made**: Full implementation of the QR code UI, including event listeners for user inputs and calls to the backend API for QR code generation.
-   **/app/test_result.md**:
    -   **Summary**: This file serves as a log for project progress, user requests, and testing outcomes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Continuously updated by the AI engineer to reflect completed tasks, backend progress, and results from backend testing.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully refactored the QR code generator application into a full-stack architecture.

On the **backend**, a custom QR code generation library () has been developed from scratch, replacing the third-party  library. This custom library handles all aspects of QR code rendering, including module drawing (squares, circles, rounded shapes), color application (via HSL to Hex conversion), and logo embedding. FastAPI endpoints in  have been implemented to expose this functionality. The backend has undergone comprehensive testing using , achieving a 100% success rate (58/58 tests passed). During this testing, the agent identified and fixed critical bounds checking issues and added color validation within the custom QR code generator, ensuring robustness.

On the **frontend**, a new React component () has been created to replicate the original application's user interface. This component includes all necessary input fields for VCard data, color sliders, logo upload, logo size control, and shape selection dropdowns for both markers and dots.  has been updated to integrate this new component, and an initial linting error (duplicate export) was promptly resolved.

A screenshot of the frontend shows that the application's UI is rendered correctly with all elements present, including the French labels, input fields, color pickers, logo upload, shape options, and action buttons. The application is now in a state where backend functionality is validated, and the frontend is visually complete and integrated with the new backend.
